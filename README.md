# Application Lifecycle Working group in Keptn

The working group is focused on standardization and interoperability with other tools. 

## Scope

- Standardization around application life cycle and deployment events within the [Keptn events spec](https://github.com/keptn/spec)
- Creation of a new standard for deployment events and CRDs, based on what we have in [Keptn Events spec](https://github.com/keptn/spec) and other projects. We had a few chats with maintainers of K8s projects, and it seems to be a good spot for us
- [Keptn Lifecycle Controller](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/lifecycle-controller) PoC, now in sandbox. This is an experimental project. The goal is to introduce a more “cloud-native” approach for pre- and post-deployment, as well as the concept of application health checks, and it could be a reference implementation for the standards suggested above.
- Collaboration with related projects, including CDEvents, K8s, Argo, OpenSLO, OpenTelemetry, etc. Ideally a lot of work could and should be upstreamed to become standards beyond just Keptn

## Meetings

Keptn [community and developer meetings](https://keptn.sh/community/meetings/) are used for now.
Special regular meetings will be created once there is a need.

## Governance

Keptn Community Governance process applies during the bootstrap.
Final governance model will be determined based on the engagements.
